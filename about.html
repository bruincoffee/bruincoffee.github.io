<div class="para"><p>This is a collaborative effort to log all of the typos in the world! 
    Well, maybe not all of them. Have you ever been walking down the street, surfing the internet, 
    or reading a book and noticed something spelled wrong or written grammatically incorrectly? 
    And did you wish there was a place to store an image you snapped of this mistake? 
    Well now there is a centralized place called <i>Mistakes Were Maid!</i>
    wherein you can do just that! 

    <br><br><br><i>Note: We all make typos &#8212 I make them all the time! 
    This isn't meant to be a GOTCHA! site. It's all in fun. I guess there is some satisfaction 
    in seeing that even professional editors of best sellers and chyron writers for major cable 
    news networks make mistakes, and this is somehow comforting and humanizing.</i></p></div>
