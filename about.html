   <p>"The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really 
    a large matter - 'tis the difference between the lightning-bug and the lightning." &#8212<i>Mark Twain</i><br>
    <br>This is a collaborative effort to sweep up and log all the world's typos!
    (Well, maybe not all of them.) Have you ever been walking down the street, surfing the internet, 
    or reading a book and noticed something spelled wrong or written grammatically incorrectly? 
    And did you wish there was a place to store an image you snapped of this mistake? 
    Well now there is a centralized place called <i><strong>Mistakes Were Maid!</strong></i>
    wherein you can do just that!<br>We also include a few items that stand out as peculiar, out of place,  
    or just plain funny.<br><br>

    Origin Story: I had been collecting screen shots and photos of errata for years and had accumulated quite an array. 
    One day I thought, "Hmmm, maybe I should start a website." Well, <i>Mistakes Were Made</i> was already taken as a 
    domain name (of course!) throughout all the dots&#8212dot com, dot org, dot this, dot that, so I decided to put my clever hat on and 
    looked up <i>Mistakes Were Maid.</i> None of the dots were taken but did it make sense? Well, first "maid" is a mistake 
    so there's the sly meta wink, and I figured if I included an image of a maid it might help (and I added a message that we 
    sweep up mistakes so an astute person may glean some corollary, i.e. a maid cleans, we are sweeping up mistakes and . . . ), 
    so I drew a maid holding a highlighter, added the image to the site and that's how it all began. 

    <br><br><br><i>Editor's Note: We all make typos &#8212 I make them all the time! 
    This isn't meant to be a pedantic <strong>GOTCHA!</strong> site. I like to think of it more as an amusing grammar site. 
    There is also some comfort in seeing that even professional editors of best sellers and 
    chyron writers for major cable news networks make the occasional error.
