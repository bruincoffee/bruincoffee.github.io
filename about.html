    <br>This is a collaborative effort to sweep up and log all the world's typos!
    Well, maybe not all of them. Have you ever been walking down the street, surfing the internet, 
    or reading a book and noticed something spelled wrong or written grammatically incorrectly? 
    And did you wish there was a place to store an image you snapped of this mistake? 
    Well now there is a centralized place called <i><strong>Mistakes Were Maid!</strong></i>
    wherein you can do just that! 

    <br><br><br><i>Editor's Note: We all make typos &#8212 I make them all the time! 
    This isn't meant to be a pedantic <strong>GOTCHA!</strong> site. I like to think of it more as an amusing grammar site. 
    There is also some comfort in seeing that even professional editors of best sellers and 
    chyron writers for major cable news networks make the occasional error.
